					"Nick is excellent. Most importantly, I was out of the country for
					most of this so Nick helped facilitate the entire process of sending
					documents, getting emailed copies around, overnighting things as
					necessary. He even helped facilitate delivery of new appliances so
					that the transaction continued smoothly. Nick will go above and beyond
					to help you and is very responsive and always cheerful. You're in good
					hands with him" ~ Claire E

					"Nicholas (Nick) is an amazing realtor. I moved for work several years
					ago and needed to sell my condo in Dallas. Nick touched base with me
					annually, like clockwork, to discuss the Dallas market and if I should
					continue to rent my condo or put it on the market. This past spring we
					decided it was time to sell. As I do live out of the state, it was
					imperative to work with a realtor that was organized, responsive and
					could handle all of the needs required to sell my condo. And that is
					EXACTLY what Nick brought to the table (down to finding/hiring a
					contractor to manage a few items that needed to be repaired per my
					agreement with my buyer. Nick offered me a turnkey service and had my
					condo under contract, at the price I wanted, and in less than a month.
					I have been in conversation with Nick for several years now discussing
					the market and my best time to sell my property. And, outside of all
					that he offered to me as a realtor (including professionalism,
					patience and the ability to listen to my needs), he is also just a
					really great guy to work with. I would recommend him to ANYONE with
					realtor needs." ~ Christina B
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					"We could not have been more impressed with how quickly and
					efficiently Nick sold our home! He kept us up-to-date on all showings
					and promptly followed up with feedback. Nick listened to us, was
					responsive to our questions and gave us his time and attention. When
					it came to negotiations and closing, Nick was the consummate
					professional and we could have been happier or luckier to have him
					working for us. His years of experience in a fast-paced industry show.
					Most importantly, we trust Nick and would enlist him with any home we
					were buying or selling!" ~ Jillian W
